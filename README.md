# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sana Rehmat!

ðŸŽ“ MSCS Student | Full Stack Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast  
I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with a focus on building scalable, user-friendly web applications. I work primarily with the MERN stack 
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have hands-on experience in developing responsive UIs, RESTful APIs, and integrating third-party services.

My projects reflect a blend of clean code practices, component-based architecture, and performance optimization. I'm also comfortable working 
with version control (Git), deployment pipelines, and cloud platforms like Vercel and Render.
I'm always open to collaboration, learning, and contributing to meaningful open-source projects. Letâ€™s build something great together!
